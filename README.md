# Contactr

Welcome to Contactr!

Contactr is a personal address book that allows you to add your contacts, organize them, and even call them right from the app (in the not-too-distant future).

### Achievements

As I didn't get much time to spend on this (with a full-time job and busy weekend), I only managed to get full CRUD on the first model (Users). The second model (Contacts) is full CRUD on the back-end (Rails), but only READ on the front-end (React). I have been trying to get a search bar working by using the local storage, but didn't quite get it figured out in time.

The log-in feature (User authentication) was a stretch goal that I didn't quite get to, but the form is there on the landing page.

Overall, I'm happy with what I managed to achieve in such a short space of time.

### Version 2.0

I'm going to continue building this app in my own time. I would love to finish off getting both models full CRUD, and User authentication working. After that is finished, I'm going to attempt to get a third party API brought in to make calls using Nexmo:
